# Huffman ASCII decoder

### Info 
Deciphers `example.txt` ASCII tree to clear text. Based on Huffman encoding.

Utterly stupid stupid program that I made at some point. Has plenty of glue
that should be amended. Maybe some day I will be enough furious that I fix 'em.

### Future plans
* Maybe some day I am enough wacko that I'll implement functionality that generates a
random tree from the given binary code input.

* Finalize `tests.c`
